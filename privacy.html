    <p><pre>Our Privacy & Security Policies
        Safeguarding your privacy and the security of your personal information is important to us. Please take a few minutes to read the following policies so that you understand how we treat your personal information. As we continuously improve and expand our services, these policies might change. So please check them out periodically. If you have questions about our policy, please click on the Feedback option to contact us via our electronic feedback form.
        
        How we collect information about you. We collect information in three ways:
        We collect information that our customers supply to us.
        We collect information from emails and other contacts sent to us by our customers and users of our website.
        We collect information electronically on all users of our website, including customers, by means of cookies.
        What personal information do we collect from our users?
        When you please order to use our online ordering service, you are required to provide us with your full legal name, email address, full street address including city, and telephone number.
        
        Security Policy.
        Your payment and personal information is always safe. Our Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read over the internet.
        
        User Data Deletion.
        User can request the data deletion in Mobile Application from the Settings Section.
        
        Children's Privacy.
        Online ordering, customer registration for online ordering, and customer feedback pages of this website are directed toward and designed for use by persons aged 13 or older. We do not establish or maintain registrations for any child whom we know to be under the age of 13. We do not solicit or knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If we discover that we have received personally identifiable information from an individual who indicates that he or she is, or whom we otherwise have reason to believe is, under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our systems.
        
        We collect additional information about how you use our website and service.
        If you contact us by letter, phone, or email through the contact information on the Feedback page, we will collect your sender information and may collect the other information you voluntarily disclose to us.
        
        We may collect user location data with the user's consent to share their location with the Indolj website or mobile apps to provide the user with a quick and better order delivery experience and suggest nearby restaurants.
        
        In the case of the rider's app, the rider mobile app may collect the rider's location information, while the Indolj Rider app is running on the mobile, or in the background to provide real-time order location to customers.
        
        Our use of cookies.
        Like many websites on the Internet, our website uses cookies. Cookies are small strings of data placed on users' personal computer hard drives during the exchange of data that happens when your browser points to our website. Cookies enable a website to identify a user's browser as a previous visitor by means of a unique string of numbers assigned on a previous visit. Our cookies assist us in collecting information on what pages of our website you access or visit, and in recording any preferences you indicate on our website. We also use cookies to make your experience on our website more personalized, and convenient.
        
        Our cookies cannot and do not retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses. If you are just browsing our website, a cookie identifies your browser and user id (and not your identity). If you place orders with us, we use cookies to assist in storing your preferences and recording other session information (a "session" is a single visit by you to our website).
        
        How do we store the information we collect?
        We store the information you provide to us and the information we collect electronically in our computer databases. We own, maintain and operate our computer servers containing our databases. Access to our computer servers is controlled by firewalls and security gatekeepers.
        
        How do we use the information we collect?
        We use the personal information about you stored in our member database in various ways. First, the next time you use our online ordering service and reach checkout page, we will call up your information from our database to make processing your order faster and easier.
        
        Shipping Policy.
        Shipped upon order.
        
        Our policies may change.
        These are our current privacy and security policies, but we reserve the right to change our website and these policies at any time. You should check these policies periodically. If our policies regarding collection, storage and use of your information change, the information collected under prior policies will continue to be governed by those policies, unless we obtain your consent to use that information in new ways.
        
        You can access your information.
        Upon your request, we will provide you with access to your unique account-related information and information from contacts that we maintain about you. In your request, please provide us with your current specific contact information so that we can accurately check our records.
        
        Please contact us with any questions or comments.
        We want you to enjoy your use of our service. If you have any questions, or believe that a violation of this policy may have occurred, please let us know. Our complete contact information is provided on the header or at home page.</pre></p>
